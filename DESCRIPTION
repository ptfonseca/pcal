Description: Calibrate p-values under a robust Bayesian perspective and obtain measures of 
    the evidence provided by the data in favor of point null hypotheses which are safer  
    and more straightforward to interpret. The p-values calibrated with pcal() can be 
    directly interpreted as either lower bounds on the posterior probabilities of point 
    null hypotheses or as lower bounds on the probability of a type I error. P-values 
    calibrated with bcal() can be interpreted as lower bounds on the odds provided by 
    the data (Bayes factors) in favor of point null hypotheses. Some utility functions
    to turn Bayes factors into Posterior probabilities and to help in the interpretation
    of bayes factors are also included.
