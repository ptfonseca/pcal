Description: Calibrate p-values under a robust Bayesian perspective and obtain measures of 
    the evidence provided by the data in falor of point null hypotheses that are 
    straightforward to interpret. The p-values calibrated with pcal() can be directly
    interpreted as either lower bounds on the posterior probability of the null hypothesis
    or as lower bounds on the probability of a type I error. P-values calibrated with 
    bcal() can be interpreted as lower bounds on the odds provided by the data 
    (Bayes factors) in favor of the null hypothesis. Some utility functions to transform
    Bayes factors into Posterior probabilities and to help in the interpretation of 
    Bayes Bayes factors are also included.
